                This is the content of the article-three.
                Life is like a lamp.
                So long the lamp is 'alive' it keeps everything around bright and shining.
                The moment it gets  extinguished,there is darkness everywhere. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly a person having a good life with love,compassion and a mission makes everything around look good.
                And with death comes the end of  a lifelong festivity.

                If we make ourselves understand the bitter truth that
                we are going to die anyway,we may be able to embrace 
                death happily and smilingly.
